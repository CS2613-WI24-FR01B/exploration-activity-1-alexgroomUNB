1. Which package/library did you select?

  I selected SciKit learn (SKlearn).

2. What is the package/library?

  SciKit is a data analysis library that allows easy access to machine learning tools such as linear regression or random forest trees. You must first have Python, then download the SciKit package. Create a Python
file then import the library. There is a user guide on their website (scikit-learn.org) that is helpful in teaching the many functions that this library offers.

3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?

- Supervised machinelLearning

- Unsupervised machine learning

- Model selection and evalution

- Data Processing

  There are many components to each of these topics, but these are the general functionalities.
4. When was it created?

  SciKit learn was started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by David Cournapeau.

5. Why did you select this package/library?

   The recent boom in how AI has been enhancing various aspects of our lives, from online assitants to image generation
   I wanted to use it to enhance an activity that I loved. SciKit learn was said to be one of the easiest and most
   popular Machine Learning libraries to use so I went with it.
  
6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?

   This project made me passionate about machine learning and the various ways that it can enhance our lives.
   Applying AI to everyday situations opens a new door to innovation and one that heavily interests me. This project
   also showed me that I could combine my career with my favourite activity (programming and golf). This library showed
   me Python's immense capibility to process and model data.

7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?

   My experience with this library was very good. SciKit has a lot of documentation and it is a popular library that
   is kept up to data, thus it was nice to work with. The concept of Machine Learning was so foreign and intimidating
   to me before this, but SciKit made it accessible. I would definitley recommend this library to those that are
   comfortable with programming and want to get ito Machine Learning. I would continue using this library as I have only
   explored a fraction of it. It's documentation is structured and informative making SciKit Learn a package I would
   like to continue to use.
